# Concept

The goal of this conference is to bring together young researchers from the Combinatorial Synergies programme.
Mornings will be dedicated to mini-courses and afternoons to research talks contributed by participants.
We will also have a workshop on the topic of mental well-being in the scope of PhD studies.

Researchers from outside the Combinatorial Synergies program are also welcome to join.

The three mini-courses will be given by:
- [Alheydis Geiger](https://www.mis.mpg.de/people/alheydis-geiger)
- [Leonid Monin](https://people.epfl.ch/leonid.monin?lang=en)
- [Martin Winter](https://martinwintermath.github.io/)
